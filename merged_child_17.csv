AT A GLANCE
Academic Achievement
Outstanding Facilities
Strong Community
Innovative Curriculum
Caring Culture
The means by which we achieve victory are as important as the victory itself.
The first sod for Victory Lutheran College was turned in 1991 in a rural paddock on the outskirts of Wodonga. Members of Wodonga Lutheran Parish had previously lobbied Lutheran Education Australia to form a school in Wodonga and subsequently purchased land when the green light was given for a new school.
About us:
Our framework of Christian attitudes and relationships provides a strong basis for the initiative of lifelong learning fostered in Victory Lutheran College which encourages living in the community and reflecting characteristics of God through core values, especially love, justice, compassion, forgiveness, service, humility, courage, hope, quality and appreciation.
Specifically, we aim to:
Provide a balanced and rigorous approach to education that encourages spiritual, social, physical emotional and academic growth
Challenge students to achieve their personal best and become active and informed citizens
Aim to develop independent and critical thinkers
Provide experiences that encourage curiosity and promote a love of learning
Encourage participation and celebrate achievement
Expand our focus to develop global understandings as well as local and national ones
Provide for tailored education to target the learning needs of students
Complete thorough assessment which encourages, supports and empowers students
Actively embrace technology to engage students

To be recognised and valued for our innovative and flexible services that enable our community to be healthy and well.
Cobaw Community Health Services Ltd was established in 1986 as an independent incorporated association identified within the Health Services Act 1988. After an extensive process undertaken by many community health centres across Victoria to redefine their legal status as charitable organisations, we became a company limited by guarantee under the Commonwealth’s Corporation Act in March 2009.
Our important aspect is the flexibility & energy to be innovative in service provision to promote healthy lifestyles to the local community & where appropriate to act collaboratively with other organisations to maximise service potential. We have embraced community health & wellbeing issues.

Child Care & Kindergarten - Long Day Child Care.
We at Little V.I.P’S childcare and Kindergarten value the importance and understand that children are unique individuals and develop at their own pace. Therefore, we provide a family-like nurturing, welcoming, and warm environment to help promote acceptance and a sense of belonging.
We ensure that children in our care see themselves as very important. As a result, they are given a voice that is heard and gives them the confidence to experiment with their ideas through hands-on experiences.
We have a resource/library centre within the centre with current brochures and booklets, videos, which may be of some use to you now, or in the future which you can borrow from the centre. They cover topics from schooling, health issues, childcare, parenting, and more. If you need specific information on a particular topic, we will endeavour to get it for you; please feel free to speak to educators.
The Centre provides a Child Care and Kindergarten service for up to 60 children between 6 weeks to 6 years of age.

Support Staff
We operate our practice management company efficiently to ensure that our clients receive value for money.
Outsource all of your administration and organisational activities to Optimal Practice Management who have over three decades experience running healthcare clinics in various fields and medical specialist clinics. Our personal approach and unique system operate every aspect of your business significantly lowering costs, increasing your income and substantially improving your practice’s profit.
How we do it
Optimal Practice Management will setup your practice with reliable uncomplicated systems and equipment to produce maximum efficiency without the unnecessary expense. Reception staff are employed and provided for your practice’s requirements, so you are not paying for an extensive overindulgent team. We have a genuine interest in making your practice more profitable and the formula is simple, increasing income and decreasing expenses results in greater profit for your practice.
What makes us different?
Most specialist practices are simple small businesses with one or two practitioners.
All that is required to run the practice are one or two receptionists, computers, printers, scanners, phones, practice management software, and a basic computer network.
Healthcare practitioners are taken advantage of and targeted because of their high income and lack of knowledge in areas outside their expertise. This is demonstrated by the high cost of simple medical equipment and its maintenance, the cost of materials and instruments, the constant propositions from scavengers tempting you to invest with them, purchase their products or properties only to line their own pockets.
Medical practice management companies are no different. They will stifle your business with expensive, complicated and unnecessary equipment and software making it unreliable and in need of regular maintenance, creating work for their IT team that your income supports. The grand team that they demonstrate on their websites to impress you, from directors at one end to receptionists at the other and all the support staff in between, are all paid for from your income.
Contact our team to discuss how we can offer you our services to improve and administer your practice.","Keywords

Goulburn Valley Hospice Care Service is a specialist palliative care service supporting people living in the city of Shepparton.
Goulburn Valley Hospice Care Service was established in 1989 in response to a deficiency in available specialist palliative care services, as reflected by an increasing number of terminally ill patients being admitted to acute care services (Hospital), with limited or no grief or bereavement support.
Goulburn Valley Hospice Care Service supports people with a life threatening illness to live well and, in doing so, provides support within the person home to improve the quality of life of individuals, carers and families.
A nurse is available to discuss a person’s concern anytime of the day or night. A team ensures the carer and family has someone to guide and support them, whenever they need. People can be referred to the service by treating doctors, local hospitals, treating specialists, allied health professionals, by self or by family members and friends.

AT A GLANCE
Wide range of financing options
Friendly team of professionals
Innovative client-focused services
Farm accounting
We believe that every client deserves personalised service. We commit to you & your business in the same way we commit to our own.
Established in 1923, GMG Financial Group emerged as the pioneering accounting firm in the region. Since then, our vision has remained steadfast: to empower our clients in achieving their financial aspirations.
Today, we operate as a partnership of 10 professionals, supported by approximately 30 staff members dedicated to assisting our Partners.
When you are looking for an accountant to look after your individual needs, we know that you want to talk to someone who you can trust to make the best choices for your situation.
Whether you are a busy person with uncomplicated tax affairs or someone who wants to benefit from the professional advice we are able to provide on complex matters, we will be there to help you out. We can reduce hassles, organise and plan your financial needs and build a long term, effective relationship with you - leaving you more time for the important things in life.
At GMG we think farmers are tops - we are inspired by the dedication and passion all of our farming clients have for what they do.
There is even the odd bit of envy from us - being cooped up inside all day sometimes makes us we wish we could spend the day outside too!
It takes a special kind of accounting professional to really help farmers out - and at GMG we keep well on top of developments, challenges and innovations across loads of farming sectors to ensure you will stay ahead. We implement a range of software solutions, and can do as little or as much of the administrative work for you so that you can have more time to spend doing what you love.
When you retire, you want to make sure you can get the most out of life and enjoy what you have worked so hard for. We want that too. With the superannuation sector growing rapidly, many people like to be able to have control over their future.
A self-managed superannuation fund administered by GMG allows you to be as hands on or off with your superannuation as you would like. We don't stop where most accountants do - we make sure you are ahead of the game by helping you access the best advice for your retirement goals. We have dedicated contacts who can help provide you with great advice on succession planning, property investment, stockbroking and much more.
Our team are always available to answer your questions and will help you stay on top of complex SMSF legislation. We use award winning superannuation software in Australia to minimise hassle and allow you to get information about your balance whenever you wish. We also have five registered SMSF auditors in our team and can provide reliable, objective services for your fund.

Community Of Learners, Doers And Shakers
Nursery Room, Toddler Rooms And Kindergarten Rooms
Experience An Inviting Space For Your Child
Six Learning Spaces And Two Outdoor Areas
We embrace the image of the child as a competent, confident, creative and active learner.
Starfish Early Learning Centre is a community of learners where the voices of families, children and educators are respected and valued. We aim to develop a sense of belonging, being and becoming, as reflected in the Early Years Learning Framework (2009) for all our families, children and educators.
Our Philosophy
We are committed to providing opportunities of play for children to explore, investigate, discover, hypothesise, make connections, imagine, create and grow. We will endeavour to create an environment that will provoke learning and allow for possibilities. Our numerous Melbourne Early Learning Centres offer your child a safe and dynamic environment where they can explore, investigate, connect, imagine, create and grow. Starfish Early Learning Centres provide quality and stimulating education and care for children aged six-weeks to kindergarten.
Our Early Learning Centres
Starfish Early Learning Centres are purpose built and architecturally designed to enhance the natural play spaces available. Our facilities consist of 6 different rooms: 2 nurseries, 2 toddlers and 2 kindergarten rooms (3 & 4 year old funded kindergarten). Each room is equipped with furniture that is fit for purpose, age appropriate and designed to enhance and promote a child’s learning experience.
Our Early-Learning Curriculum
We believe that all children are unique individuals who are coming from families with different cultural backgrounds, behaviours, views and levels of developmental needs. We strive to provide a curriculum that provides each child with multiple learning opportunities through play-based learning such as sensory experiences, construction, music and movement, art expressions, projects and many more.

Children learn, think, imagine, make up stories and communicate with each other and the world around them through play.
At The Hive, we hire only the best, most dedicated, highly trained & caring educators. Our educators are passionate about work & have a strong desire to make a real difference in the life of your child. Our educators will take the time to learn about your child & their unique interests. They will work with you, the parent, who knows your child the best to help them learn more about your child.
We believe that families need to be a part of their child’s growth and daily routine. We will regularly communicate with you on how your child is progressing and their day-to-day experiences. A child’s first instinct is to play. Children love to run, climb, hop, skip, dance, catch, throw, roll down hills, to make noise and to dance.
At the Hive, we include a variety of activities to keep our children as fit and healthy as they can be. Exercise through play is the best way to engage children and that is why it forms a big part of our fitness programs.
Our Buzzing Fit Bees programs focus on developing physical skills from an early age while also building fitness through fun activities.
We have a library at all our centres and all of them are filled with well-loved children’s story books and award winning children’s literature which provides children with many opportunities to increase their language and communication skills.

Children learn, think, imagine, make up stories and communicate with each other and the world around them through play.
At The Hive, we hire only the best, most dedicated, highly trained & caring educators. Our educators are passionate about work & have a strong desire to make a real difference in the life of your child. Our educators will take the time to learn about your child & their unique interests. They will work with you, the parent, who knows your child the best to help them learn more about your child.
We believe that families need to be a part of their child’s growth and daily routine. We will regularly communicate with you on how your child is progressing and their day-to-day experiences. A child’s first instinct is to play. Children love to run, climb, hop, skip, dance, catch, throw, roll down hills, to make noise and to dance.
At the Hive, we include a variety of activities to keep our children as fit and healthy as they can be. Exercise through play is the best way to engage children and that is why it forms a big part of our fitness programs.
Our Buzzing Fit Bees programs focus on developing physical skills from an early age while also building fitness through fun activities.
We have a library at all our centres and all of them are filled with well-loved children’s story books and award winning children’s literature which provides children with many opportunities to increase their language and communication skills.

Community Kids Haven Redan provides outstanding care & early years learning for your child between ages of six weeks to six years.
At Community Kids Haven, we hire only the best, most dedicated, highly trained and caring educators. Our educators are passionate about their work & have a strong desire to make a real difference in life of your child. They will work with you, the parent, who knows your child best to help them learn more about your child & their background & culture so we can deepen their learning opportunities.
Dedication:
The number one quality that all our educators possess is dedication. We believe that educators don’t only need to be passionate but dedicated to bringing out the best in our children. Our educators are dedicated to the love of learning and inspire the children under their care.
Patience:
Along with an underlying desire for teaching and a love for children, our educators display and have plenty of patience. Children that come to our Centres all have varying developmental needs and different interests and experiences at home and might come from a non-English speaking or multi-cultural background. Children need to be constantly reminded of moral values, ethics, manners, hygiene, classroom procedures and routines. It takes patience to look after each child and we believe that is one of the most important skills that our educators have.

Services:
Manual Therapy
Manual Therapy is an extremely effective therapeutic method in the management of patients with pain and musculoskeletal disorders.
Rehabilitation Exercises
Our Therapists identify and optimise movement patterns through specifically tailored exercise programs. We will coach you to gradually get relaxed, mobile, strong, and active to achieve your goals.
Electrotherapy
Electrotherapy includes a range of treatments using shock wave therapy, ultrasound, and interferential therapy to reduce pain, improve circulation, repair tissues, and strengthen muscles.
Dry Needling
Dry needling helps release the knot and relieve any muscle pain or spasms.
Pilates Rehabilitation
More than just a regular exercise, our Therapists would recommend Pilates exercise for rehabilitation treatment after an injury.
Traction Rehabilitation
Spinal traction stretches the spine to release pressure from compressed discs. This straightens the spine and improves the body’s ability to heal itself.

We aim to help students across Victoria understand their true potential and perform better in their passion for music.
The Classic Arts School of Music was established in 1995 with them aim of imparting education and helping interested students learn the art of music.

The Classic Arts School of Music has 25 years of teaching experience and was established in Kings Park in 1995. We teach classical and contemporary styles of music.

Our music teachers use various methods for teaching, including AMEB, structured, and traditional.

St Albans School Of Music is a long established music school in St Albans.
The St.Albans School of Music began operating back in the 1970’s and has been running continuously since then. Each teacher is aware of academic pressures students face, so the lessons can be tailored so as to not interfere with any school work, but may in fact enhance it.
The St. Albans School of Music currently conducts classes in Piano/Keyboard, Guitar, Bass Guitar, Ukulele, Violin, Singing and vocal Musical Theatre Training and Drums. The lessons are all conducted on a one to one basis but small groups can be organised, preferably on enrolment at the same time.
Lesson content is very flexible and the teachers try to respond to the students interests as much as possible.

In 2017, I completed MSL training with the Australian Dyslexia Association. I proceeded to offer this form of language assistance in my tutoring business, to students with diagnosed dyslexia & other learning disabilities.
Welcome! We hope you have a rewarding year in 2024.
We offer both individual & group tuition and set programs which improve on areas of weakness including Literacy & Numeracy, consolidate classwork, develop exam study techniques, provide special Multi sensory Language programs for students with dyslexia & other learning disabilities. All related to the student’s ability, readiness to learn, interests &expressed learning style.
Our past students’ year 12 results have achieved ATAR scores as high as 99.5. You too, can achieve your potential at any level!
In 2019, Dennis was awarded Associate Membership of the Australia Dyslexic Association after completing 100 hours of a teacher internship.
In 2023, we tutored students who were successful in VCE Specialist Maths, Maths Methods, General Maths, Physics and Chemistry. In this holiday period, before the start of the 2024 school year, we are offering discounted tuition.

AT A GLANCE
Three Decades Experience
Practice Management Software
Professional And Cost Effective
Regular Maintenance
Support Staff
We operate our practice management company efficiently to ensure that our clients receive value for money.
Outsource all of your administration and organisational activities to Optimal Practice Management who have over three decades experience running healthcare clinics in various fields and medical specialist clinics. Our personal approach and unique system operate every aspect of your business significantly lowering costs, increasing your income and substantially improving your practice’s profit.
How we do it
Optimal Practice Management will setup your practice with reliable uncomplicated systems and equipment to produce maximum efficiency without the unnecessary expense. Reception staff are employed and provided for your practice’s requirements, so you are not paying for an extensive overindulgent team. We have a genuine interest in making your practice more profitable and the formula is simple, increasing income and decreasing expenses results in greater profit for your practice.
What makes us different?
Most specialist practices are simple small businesses with one or two practitioners.
All that is required to run the practice are one or two receptionists, computers, printers, scanners, phones, practice management software, and a basic computer network.
Healthcare practitioners are taken advantage of and targeted because of their high income and lack of knowledge in areas outside their expertise. This is demonstrated by the high cost of simple medical equipment and its maintenance, the cost of materials and instruments, the constant propositions from scavengers tempting you to invest with them, purchase their products or properties only to line their own pockets.
Medical practice management companies are no different. They will stifle your business with expensive, complicated and unnecessary equipment and software making it unreliable and in need of regular maintenance, creating work for their IT team that your income supports.

Section 32 of the Sale of Land Act sets out what must be in the statement. We will advise you of the details we require. These  details are vitally important and must be accurate and not misleading. If it is not prepared properly, it may be possible for a  purchaser to withdraw from the contract at any time prior to settlement.
Vines Conveyancing - Selling and Buying
When you are planning to sell your property there are a large number of things to be done:
Select an appropriate agent for selling your property in your area. Have the agent inspect the property and give an idea of a probable price range. The agent will advise you on the best method of sale, advertising and improvements to the property that will help you achieve a speedy and satisfactory result. The agent will quote for you their scale of charges. Remember that there is no official scale of charges anymore and this fee is negotiable. The agent will ask you to have a Vendors Statement prepared for the sale.
Contact Vinces Conveyancing
Section 32 of the Sale of Land Act sets out what must be in the statement. We will advise you of the details we require. These details are vitally important and must be accurate and not misleading. If it is not prepared properly, it may be possible for a purchaser to withdraw from the contract at any time prior to settlement.
Documents we will need are:
Current copy of your Title
Current copy of your Rate notices (Municipal and Water)
Copy certificate of occupancy (if recently built home)
Housing Guarantee Fund Certificate or other similar insurance document
Details of any building permits granted within the last seven years
Details of any buildings that have been constructed over any easement
Details of any notice or order regarding the property
Details of any tenancy agreements
If you are an owner / builder - special rules apply and we will need to discuss your position carefully with you before preparing the Vendors Statement.
Once your agent has found a buyer for you, either your agent will prepare a Contract of Sale or they will request us to have a formal contract prepared for you. If they require a formal contract, we will have our solicitors, Vines Lawyers, prepare that on your behalf.
Remember – purchasers may have a right to cool off within three days after signing the contract. We will explain this right to you.
Once the contract has been signed and exchanged there are many steps to cover.
Conditions such as approval of finance or selling of existing home may have to be fulfilled before your contract becomes unconditional. It is therefore very important that you do not consider the contract unconditional until we can confirm this with you. We will contact your mortgagee and arrange for them to prepare documents to discharge your mortgage at settlement. They will also provide us with the payout figures.
Deposit money can be released prior to settlement. This is not automatic and you should discuss this with us before relying on the release being made.
Transfer documentation must be signed in plenty of time before settlement.
The purchaser may exercise his/her rights to inspect the property in the week prior to settlement. As you have a duty to maintain the property in the same condition as when originally inspected by the purchaser, it is always wise to expect that they will do so. Please make sure that all chattels remaining with the property are in place and that the garden is well maintained.
Prior to settlement you should advise your electricity, telephone and gas services of your move and have them read your meters on settlement day. The purchasers will make their own arrangements.
Settlement will be taken care of by us.

Established in 1893, Wightons Lawyers has been servicing the legal needs of individuals and businesses throughout Geelong for over 130 years. We are committed to continuing our strong legacy of providing effective legal services to a standard beyond our client’s expectations in a professional, prompt, honest and efficient manner.
Justine Finlay (our managing director) and Jesse Rankine are accredited specialists in the field of Wills and Estates.
We have the knowledge and experience to provide you with expert advice.
We prepare all types of Wills depending on our client’s requirements, including Wills that incorporate testamentary trusts and / or special disability trusts. We also prepare mutual will agreements and provide succession planning advice that covers superannuation, trusts and businesses.
Additionally, we cover Enduring Powers of Attorney as a part of our succession plan for our clients.
We regularly act on behalf of executors in relation to obtaining probate of Wills and the administration of estates.
Our team is particularly experienced in Will challenges. We run cases for our clients in both the Supreme Court of Victoria and the County Court of Victoria. Because we act for both Plaintiffs and Defendants, we are well aware of the opportunities and difficulties surrounding these claims. In addition to claims for further provision, we have also assisted our clients with Will caveats where we object to probate of Wills made in certain circumstances.
